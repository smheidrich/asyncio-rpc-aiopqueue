Decorator+AiopQueue example
===========================

Like the decorator example from asyncio-rpc's repo, except it uses the
AiopQueue commlayer for communication between a multiprocessing.Process and its
parent (so not true RPC, rather IPC).


Running example
---------------

No preparation required, just run `python3 client.py`.
